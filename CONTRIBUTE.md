# Contributing to NER-Entity-Mapper ðŸš€
Welcome to NER-Entity-Mapper! ðŸŽ‰ We appreciate your contributions and collaboration. Please follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth and effective development process.

## ðŸ“Œ Branching Strategy
We follow a structured Git workflow for efficient development:

main â†’ Stable branch (Production-ready code only)
dev â†’ Development branch (All feature branches merge here first)
feature/xyz â†’ Feature-specific branches
fix/xyz â†’ Bug fixes
refactor/xyz â†’ Code improvements


## Example Commit Messages:

âœ… feat: Added Named Entity Linking model
âœ… fix: Resolved encoding issue in text preprocessing
âœ… refactor: Optimized API response time

## ðŸš€ Best Practices for Collaboration
âœ… Work in small increments: Avoid huge PRs with multiple unrelated changes.
âœ… Push frequently: Donâ€™t let your feature branch get too outdated.
âœ… Keep discussions in PRs: Use comments and reviews for feedback.
âœ… Communicate issues: If you're stuck, ask for help early.

## ðŸ’¡ Contribution Guidelines
Make sure your code is well-documented and follows best practices.
Add tests where necessary and ensure all tests pass before opening a PR.
Update the README.md or relevant documentation if your changes require it.
Be respectful and constructive in discussions and code reviews.
